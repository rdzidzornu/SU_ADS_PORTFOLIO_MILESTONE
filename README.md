### Description  
The Applied Data Science Program at Syracuse University is designed provide students with skillsets to collect, transform, manage, analyze, and develop in-depth understanding of data. It provides students with the practical analytical and technical skills to apply analytical concepts to gain insight from small and large datasets with no limitation to form or nature. Some of the underlying skills that were developed through courses like Applied Data Science(IST707), Data Visualization(IST719), Data Admin & Database Management(IST659),  Data Analytics(IST707), Text Mining(IST736) include but not limited to scripting in SQL and using Python and R programing language for data analysis. The program as rigorous and challenging as it is will enable students to be more valuable and key contributors in their various organizations. While the overall program focuses on applications of data science to enterprise operations and processes, individual courses tackle data handling issues such as data capture, management, analysis, and communication for decision-making.
