##       Description 
The Church Ministry Database project, covered the design and creation of a database to track the activities and programs attendance of a local church from scratch using the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). The objective was to create a one stop data source for the church, which in the past, had no organized data on its overall activities in order to monitor the progress and growth of the church by leveraging tools such as MS SQL Server, MS Visio, MS Access, Excel and Tableaus for data visualization and analysis.
